================================================================
RUNNING THE PROGRAM
1) cd into the src directory
2) type: javac manage/MemSimMain.java
3) type: java manage/MemSimMain
4) enter the test file name
5) the results should be printed in analysis.txt and translog.txt

We originally did all the coding in Eclipse so the classpaths are kinda messed up.
Which is why we have to compile everything from the src directory, not the manage directory.

After you compile and run everything, you can go inside of manage and type:
make clean
to clean up all the .class files.
