RUNNING THE PROGRAM
1) cd into the src directory
2) type: javac manage/MemSimMain.java
3) type: java manage/MemSimMain
4) enter the test file name
5) the results should be printed in analysis.txt and translog.txt

We originally did all the coding in Eclipse so the classpaths are kinda messed up.
Which is why we have to compile everything from the src directory, not the manage directory.

After you compile and run everything, you can go inside of manage and type:
make clean
to clean up all the .class files.

NOTES ABOUT TIME EFFICIENCIES
- We found that executing the program in different environments caused different timings
    - running it on the ugrad servers made it significantly longer than running it in Eclipse
- When doing the bucket sort, we were considering two different implementations, either using 
  a linked list or a 1d array.  Using the linked list resulted in longer times, but was more space
  efficient than using arrays, so we ended up using a linked list implementation.
